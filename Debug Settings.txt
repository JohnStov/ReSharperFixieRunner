Visual Studio rekons that debug settings are user specific, and I always forget how I need to set this up, so this for anyone trying to debug the Fixie plugin and not knowing where to start.

In the FixiePlugin project, choose 'Properties' and got to the 'Debug' section
Under 'Start Action', choose 'Start external program', and enter the path to Visual Studio. For me this is C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 11.0\Common7\IDE\devenv.exe

Under 'Start Options', add the following in the 'Command line arguments' box:
	/RootSuffix <suffix> - this tells VS to use the experimental hive rather than the default hive for settings. Save you trashing your working VS environment. I generally use 'Exp' as my suffix.
	/ReSharper.Internal - load the ReSharper internal development menu. Gives you access to useful ReSharper Internals
	/ReSharper.Plugin <assembly> - tells ReSharper to load the specified assembly as an additional plugin. if you don't provide a full path, it looks in the project's ouput folder.

So the full command line is 
	/RootSuffix Exp /ReSharper.Internal /ReSharper.Plugin FixiePlugin.dll
